A Shiny app visualizing the export status of cultural publication of China from 2008 to 2014.

Ways to use the app:

1.Download the repository to local. Launch the app in R with the following commands:
```#install.packages("shiny")
#setpw("/path/to/local/")
library(shiny)
runApp("export_app")```

2. runUrl
I've saved the Shiny app's directory as a zip file(i.e. export_app.zip).
runUrl will download and launch a Shiny app straight from a weblink. That is:
```library(shiny)
runUrl("<the web link>")```

3. runGitHub
You can launch the app by running:
```runGitHub("<repository name>", "<your name>")```

4. runGist
I copy the app files to the Gist web page ....
You can launch teh app with:
```runGist("number")```

5. Host the app as web page
